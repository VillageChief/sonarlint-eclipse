SonarLint for Eclipse
=====================

Installing and using
--------------------

See https://www.sonarlint.org/eclipse and https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/sonarlint  

For offline installation and older versions see the update site archive at https://bintray.com/sonarsource/SonarLint-for-Eclipse/releases

Building
--------

    mvn clean verify

Development setup in Eclipse
----------------------------


1. Run `mvn compile` on the command line to fetch artifacts referenced in the parent pom
2. In Eclipse, import the project root as Maven project
3. In Eclipse, import the `its/` folder as Maven project
4. Open `target-platform-its-e47/target-platform-its-e47-dev.target`
    - Click on **Environment** tab and add `M2_REPO` variable pointing to your local maven repo (for example `/home/youruser/.m2/repository`)
    - On the **Definition** tab, click **Reload**
    - Click **Set as Target Platform** (or **Reload Target Platform**) in the top-right corner

At this point you should be all set, unless Eclipse is not able to generate protobuf sources.
Following the explanations [here](https://github.com/trustin/os-maven-plugin) may help.
As a workaround, you can run `mvn compile` on the command line to generate protobuf sources,
and in Eclipse hit `F5` on the project with build errors.

In some (older?) flavors of Eclipse, you may need to install `m2eclipse` and then Tycho extension to `m2eclipse`:

1. Window -> Preferences -> Maven -> Discovery -> Open Catalog
2. Install **Tycho Configurator**

### Eclipse quirks

Strange issues in Eclipse and their remedies.

- Sometimes, for no apparent reason, the generated protobuf classes may disappear,
  and Eclipse may report compilation errors when resolving these class names, symbols.
  The workaround is to run `mvn compile` and refresh the views in Eclipse (click on the project and press `F5`).

Running
-------

Open `plugin.xml` of `org.sonarline.eclipse.core` (for example), and see the **Run** and **Debug** buttons in the top-right corner.

Running plugin unit tests
-------------------------

In Eclipse:

1. Create a run configuration by running a test class first with **Run As... / JUnit Plug-in Test**

2. Edit the configuration

    - On the **Test** tab, uncheck **Run in UI thread**
    - On the **Main** tab, under **Program to Run**, select **Run an application** with value **[No Application] - Headless Mode**

With Maven:

    mvn clean verify

Running ITs
-----------

To run ITs for the default target platform and SonarQube version you can use a helper script:

    ./scripts/run-its.sh --init  # start X server for windows opened by the tests
    ./scripts/run-its.sh

This assumes that the project was already `mvn` installed. You may want to run a specific test to avoid running everything:

    ./scripts/run-its.sh -Dtest=SimpleNameOfClass

Run with `-h` or `--help` to see other options.

The script uses Xephyr and assumes the `metacity` window manager is present.
The purpose of this is to open windows in an isolated X server to avoid interference with your desktop.

If you get some error when opening the JS Editor, read:

Adding a dependency
-------------------

Must be osgi bundle.

### For Maven

Add the artifact to the parent pom.

Run `mvn compile` to get the artifact downloaded so that you can inspect its manifest in the jar.

Find the name of the bundle from its manifest, see the `Bundle-SymbolicName` property.

Edit the manifest of the package where you want to add the dependency (for example: `org.sonarlint.eclipse.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`), add the bundle in the `Require-Bundle` property, using its symbolic name.

If the bundle is not needed at runtime, don't forget to mark it optional, to avoid including in the package.
(Edit properties on the **Dependencies** tab, or append `;resolution:=optional`)

To verify the content of the package: `mvn clean package` and check content of the ZIP in plugins folder.

### For Eclipse

Add to `target-platform-its-e47/target-platform-its-e47-dev.target` (or whatever target you use) the path of the artifact in your local maven repository as a filesystem path, similar to already existing dependencies.

In the target editor (or open `plugin.xml`), click **Set as Target Platform**.
Note that this will trigger a compilation in Eclipse.

At this point, and if the artifact exists at the specified path, it should be usable, and Eclipse will be able to compile the project.
